## Features
- Exploratory analysis of claim length, word count, and average word length.
- Sentiment analysis using TextBlob and VADER.
- Wordclouds and bigram analysis to identify common keywords in fake vs. real headlines.
- Interactive plots using Plotly.

## Data
The dataset contains COVID-19 news headlines labeled as `Fake` or `Real`.


## Installation
